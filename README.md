Virtual Reality Tourism and Gamification for Pediatric Oncology Patients

The project involves developing a Virtual Reality (VR) experience for pediatric oncology patients aged 7-11, focusing on educational tourism. It aims to create an immersive VR environment replicating SeaWorld, Abu Dhabi, providing a therapeutic escape from medical treatments. Integrating VR technology, gamification, and an AI VR assistant, the system allows children to navigate SeaWorld, watch video tours, interact with elements, and play educational games. The project emphasizes smooth, comfortable navigation to ensure patient safety. Key features include a GPT-powered AI assistant tailored for children, and data analytics to refine the VR experience based on user feedback and psychological impact. This innovative approach enhances well-being and cognitive development, positioning the VR system as a valuable tool in pediatric healthcare.The project involves developing a Virtual Reality (VR) experience for pediatric oncology patients aged 7-11, focusing on educational tourism.

The innovative ideas and features incorporated into the project are multifaceted and hold significant potential for enhancing the well-being and assisting the cognitive development of pediatric oncology patients. The integration of VR Technology and Gamification not only provides an immersive and engaging experience but also serves as a valuable educational tool, offering young patients an opportunity to learn and explore in a safe and stimulating environment. The AI VR Assistant, which incorporates a GPT model, introduces an element of interactivity and personalized guidance, catering to the unique needs of each child. The Fine-tuning of the GPT model allows the experience to be tailored for the children in the age group of 7-11 years. Furthermore, the critical consideration of non-functional requirements, such as the avoidance of abrupt movements, reflects a deep understanding of the sensitivities and vulnerabilities of the target users, ensuring a safe and comfortable experience. Additionally, Data Analytics will be performed to understand the psychological effect the system has on the children and refine the VR experience. The project's emphasis on Educational Tourism and its potential to positively impact the cognitive development and emotional well-being of pediatric oncology patients underscores the merits of these innovative features, positioning the VR system as a promising and impactful assistive tool for pediatric healthcare.
